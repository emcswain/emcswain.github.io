         <h2 class="headings">About Us</h2>
         <p>Active Culture started with a family passion of cooking flavorful wholesome food. That passion turned into a vision, and after many “tastings” in Faye’s kitchen to make sure the food was delivering a punch of flavor and a wholesome meal, the first Active Culture came to life in charming Laguna Beach, CA in 2010. Our menu started out with only a few items, and over the years has grown and evolved to offer a wide range of tasty dishes from breakfast to dinner!</p>
         <p>The four partners of Active Culture, Faye, Katrina, Jennifer and Johann love nothing more than to see people of all ages enjoying our food. As a family owned business, we are dedicated to keeping the family atmosphere that so many of our customers and employees have come to love. And as the business continues to grow, so does the family. We have a devoted team of creative culinary experts, and bright, innovated hospitality professionals. We like to think we have the greatest staff around dedicated to bringing customers food that fuels their bodies and souls!</p>
